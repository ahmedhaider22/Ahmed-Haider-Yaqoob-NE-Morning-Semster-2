Q1

global keyword: This is used within a function to access a global variable. When i declare a variable as 
global within a function, I'm telling PHP to look for that variable in the global scope rather than creating a new local variable with the same name.

$GLOBALS: This is a PHP superglobal array that holds references to all variables which are currently defined in the 
global scope of the script. It allows accessing global variables directly without needing to use the global keyword within functions.

Q2

No we cannot write the global keyword with capital letters. PHP is case-sensitive
and keywords like global must be written in lowercase. Writing it in uppercase (GLOBAL) would result in a syntax error

Q3

<?php
$countries = array(
    "Italy" => Roma",
    "UK" => "London",
    "France" => "Paris",
    "Germany" => "Berlin",
    "Japan" => "Tokyo"
);

arsort($countries);

foreach ($countries as $country => $capital) {
    echo "$country - $capital <br>";
}
?>
