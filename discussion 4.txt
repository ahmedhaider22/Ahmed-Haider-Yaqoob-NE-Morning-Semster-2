Q1

A regular expression (regex) is a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern, mainly used for pattern matching within strings.
 In PHP, regular expressions are commonly used for tasks such as validating input, searching and replacing substrings, and extracting
 information from strings. They are implemented through functions provided by PHP's PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) extension.

Q2

Commonly Used Regular Expression Functions in PHP:
preg_match(): Searches a string for a pattern and returns true if the pattern is found, false otherwise.
preg_match_all(): Searches a string for all matches of a pattern and returns the number of matches found.
preg_replace(): Searches a string for a pattern and replaces all occurrences of the pattern with a specified replacement.
preg_split(): Splits a string by a regular expression pattern.
preg_quote(): Escapes special characters in a string for use in a regular expression pattern.

Q3

Difference between preg_match() and preg_match_all():

preg_match(): Returns true if the pattern is found in the string, otherwise false. It stops searching after the first match is found.
preg_match_all(): Returns the number of matches found in the string. It continues searching for all matches throughout the string.

Q4

<?php

$string = "Contact us at info@example.com or support@example.org for assistance.";

$new_string = preg_replace("/\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b/", "EMAIL_ADDRESS", $string);

echo $new_string;
?>
